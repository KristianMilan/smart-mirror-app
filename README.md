# smart-mirror-app
Android app for a beautiful (some would add unnecessary) smart mirror.

In essence, it is a tablet showing customizable date from behind a two-way mirror. Many similar projects exists, and the code for the app itself is largely from @ineptech. 
I added the following features:
- added a "Gmail Messenger" module, where emails sent to one account are displayed through the mirror (this is to communicate with friends that all have a mirror).
- in the weather forecast module, added support for icons asscoieted with weather
- added protection with api and passwords

Here is a brief description of how I built the mirror.

First, I bought a two-way acrilic mirror from cutplasticsheeting.co.uk (wasn't easy to find a cheap one in the UK!).

Fitted the mirror in a frame I had, positioned a table (Fusion-S) in one of the corners, and covered the rest with black construction paper.

Devised a little mechanism to lock the tablet using chopsticks.

Fixed things in place.

Kinde of end result. Note that the app has changed substantially from the time this photo was taken, and there are now icons fir the weather forecast and few mroe fixes.

TYou'll obv need a tablet and a 2-way mirror. Chopsticks maybe. Here is how much I paid: 
mirror: £40 (online) 
tablet: £20 (off gumtree) 
frame: free 
bolt and nut & tape: about £10. 
In retrospect, a glass mirror would have looked way better (the plastic one warps like crazy). Similarly, a tablet with a better screen would have reduced that nasty "back lit" effect.
