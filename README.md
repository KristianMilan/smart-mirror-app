# smart-mirror-app
Android app for a beautiful (some would add unnecessary) smart mirror.

In essence, it is a tablet showing customizable date from behind a two-way mirror. Many similar projects exists, and the code for the app itself is largely from @ineptech. 
I added the following features:
- added a "Gmail Messenger" module, where emails sent to one account are displayed through the mirror (this is to communicate with friends that all have a mirror).
- in the weather forecast module, added support for icons asscoieted with weather
- added protection with api and passwords

Here is a brief description of how I built the mirror.

First, I bought a two-way acrilic mirror from cutplasticsheeting.co.uk (wasn't easy to find a cheap one in the UK).
